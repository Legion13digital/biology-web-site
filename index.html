                        <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.</p>
                        <p>Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres to 33.6 metres and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs.</p>
                        <p>The study of animals is called zoology. Most living animal species are in the Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes—in which many groups of invertebrates are found, such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs—and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and chordates.</p>

                        <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.</p>
                        <p>Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.</p>
                        <p>Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing. Domesticated and undomesticated birds are important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.</p>

                        <p>The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water. Another definition is "any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided".</p>
                        <p>Ocean life is incredibly diverse and includes organisms ranging from microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton to the largest animal on Earth, the blue whale. Marine habitats include coastal zones, intertidal zones, sandy shores, rocky shores, mudflats, swamps and salt marshes, estuaries, kelp forests, seagrasses, and coral reefs.</p>
                        <p>Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other marine bodies of water. Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy.</p>

                        <p>Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes.</p>
                        <p>There are about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce seeds. Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems.</p>
                        <p>Plants play critical roles in ecosystems by producing oxygen through photosynthesis, forming the base of most food webs, regulating the water cycle, and preventing soil erosion. They also provide habitats for numerous organisms and are essential for human survival as sources of food, medicine, building materials, and fuel.</p>

                        <p>Trees are perennial plants with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.</p>
                        <p>Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world.</p>
                        <p>Trees provide many materials for human use such as timber, fruits, nuts, and medicinal compounds. They have been revered throughout history in many cultures and religions for their spiritual significance and longevity. The study of trees is called dendrology, and the care of trees is arboriculture or forestry.</p>
